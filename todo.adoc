= Issues:
My code is not currect, I have an issue that I looking at a nodes like a window
If the type is not a window, I only need to pass the width to the next node

= Future plans:

New configuration format:

```yaml
nodes:
  - type: vertical
    nodes:
      - width: 70
        type: horizontal
        nodes:
          - width: 60
            type: window
          - width: 40
            type: window
      - width: 25
        type: vertical
        nodes:
          - width: 50
            type: window
          - width: 50
            type: window
      - width: 5
        type: window
```
